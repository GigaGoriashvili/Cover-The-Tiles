# Cover-The-Tiles
# Mini-Game
This is the two-person dice game.

Two player compete each other in every round. The respective player roles two dices and computes the sum of the
obtained numbers. Player always rolls two dice and covers two tiles matching the sum of the dice roll. For example, if the dice show a 2 and a 3, player may cover one of 2 and 3 or 1 and 4. Selected ones are turned over. If no such option is available, by inputing zeroes, the player's account is credited with the total of all open boxes.

There are a total of 10 rounds played, and each round consists of one option made by each player. Whoever has the smallest account balance wins. The player who successfully closes the final remaining boxes in a round wins instantly, regardless of the account values earned.
